Reinforcement Learning for Pokemon Red/Blue Version

Initially inspired by Peter Whidden's excellent video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY&ab_channel=PeterWhidden) and GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/PWhiddy/PokemonRedExperiments)

Currently, this build uses a modified version of [PyBoy](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy), specifically a flavor of the version in development in [this pull request](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/pull/176). This pull request dramatically expands the available data fetchable by function call (thank you to [MaciekBaron](https://github.com/MaciekBaron) for their hard work in implementing these). Ideally one day a version of this data is available as part of the main PyBoy build so it's more easily accesible.
